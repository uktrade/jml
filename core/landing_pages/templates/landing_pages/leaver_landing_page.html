            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What it is and why it is needed</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The {{ SERVICE_NAME }} is intended to replace the multiple forms and other processes currently used when someone leaves {{ DEPARTMENT_ACRONYM }}.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                This means that not only is the experience of leaving {{ DEPARTMENT_ACRONYM }} more efficient and simple to complete, It also ensures that the department has good record keeping on all aspects of leaving.
            </p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What it does</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The {{ SERVICE_NAME }} allows for contracted or Civil Servant staff to provide information needed by the department for offboarding purposes.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The service automatically notifies the various {{ DEPARTMENT_ACRONYM }} directorates who have responsibility of ensuring that a leaver's access to software, tools and services is removed.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Additionally, it ensures that payroll is updated so that final salaries can be paid promptly.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What it does not do</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The service does not provide the ability to officially resign from a post. It assumes that the required agreement for leaving the department has already taken place.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">It does not currently cover:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>loans or temporary loans</li>
                <li>transfers to other government departments</li>
                <li>retirement, partial retirement or retirement due to ill health</li>
                <li>dismissal</li>
                <li>death in service</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Once you have logged in (no sign up necessary), the service will guide you through the process of providing information relevant to your offboarding. This may include:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>security clearance level</li>
                <li>access to Cirrus or Rosa kit</li>
                <li>additional IT equipment</li>
                <li>outstanding holiday or flexi time</li>
                <li>leaving date and last working date</li>
                <li>correspondence details</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                By adding or confirming these details, the service can then provide information to the various staff who administer offboarding in {{ DEPARTMENT_ACRONYM }}.
            </p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we would like you to do</h2>
